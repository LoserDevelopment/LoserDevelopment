Hi there, I’m Loser.
I’m interested in software development and am an australian high schooler with experience in python, HTML and CSS.
I am also trying to learn Javascript, as I am interested in web development.
I have made websites in the past using the python framework flask. I have also made apps using swift before, and have made small games using Unity.
I'm also trying to help out people as much as I can, even though I am a beginner.
You can support me at ko-fi.com/loserdev and reach me at my discord actuallyloser#0001!
