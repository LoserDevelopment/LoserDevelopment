## Hi there, I’m Loser.

I’m interested in software development and am an australian high schooler with experience in Python, HTML and CSS.
I also have a YouTube channel where I play games, which you can find at solo.to/actuallyloser

- I am currently trying to learn Javascript, as I am interested in more advanced web development.

- I have made websites in the past using the python framework flask, and basic node.js

- I have also made apps using swift before, and have made small games using Unity.
