<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hi there, I’m Loser!</h1>

I’m interested in software development and am an australian high schooler with experience in Python, HTML and CSS.

<br>

I also have a YouTube channel where I play games, which you can find at <a href="solo.to/actuallyloser" target="_blank">solo.to/actuallyloser</a>

<br>

- I am currently trying to learn Javascript, as I am interested in more advanced web development

- I have made websites in the past using the python framework flask, and basic node.js

- I have also made apps using swift before, and have made small games using Unity
